# Light Sensor
This is a simple example that will take the value from the light sensor and display it on the LED. 

### Libraries
Circuit libraries are included in the lib folder, just copy them to the Pico. To update them you need to download the Adafruit 8.x-mpy Bundle from [here](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) and update the specific libraries required by the sample code.
