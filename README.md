# Pico-RBG-Matrix-P3-64x32
This is the example micropython code for the [Waveshare Pico RGB Matrix Clock](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-RGB-Matrix-P3-64x32). 

## Requirements
The samples require using the adafruit CircuitPython as well as Adafruit CircuitPython libraries.

### CircuitPython Version 8.x.x
They were originally found using the 7.1.1 release but are in the process of being updated to the latest 8.0.0.beta 4 version. To install download the latest 8.x.x version from [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/). 

### Libraries
Circuit libraries are included in the lib folder, just copy them to the Pico. To update them you need to download the Adafruit 8.x-mpy Bundle from [here](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) and update the specific libraries required by the sample code. 

### Documents
The schematics for this are included in the documents folder for reference.
